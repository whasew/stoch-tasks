# rstudio and git

RStudio canâ€™t create branches directly, so you need to either:

- create them in GitHub and pull the changes in your repository;
- create them from the Shell (Tools > Shell) and type git checkout -b new-branch


```{r branch,eval=FALSE}
system("git checkout -b survival")
system("git push origin survival")
```

Close the window, and go back to the shell. There, type:

git push origin proposed-fixes

This command sends your modification to your fork on GitHub.

git push origin proposed-fixes

git remote -v
